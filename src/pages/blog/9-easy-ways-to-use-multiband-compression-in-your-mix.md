Multiband compression can be confusing. It’s a powerful tool that’s easily abused — and often misunderstood. For a mastering engineer, it’s a vital part of the toolkit. But what about mixing? Is multiband compression better left for the mastering stage? Or are there effective, simple ways to harness the power of this tool when mixing?

In this article you’ll learn nine practical ways to start enhancing your mixes with multiband compression. The benefits are numerous: more control, tighter low end, fuller vocals, less harshness, and a clearer top end. But first, if you really want to use multiband compression like a pro — and get it right every time you open up a mix…

Read through the free multiband compression cheat sheet below before we start.

### 1. Controlling Lead Vocals

Let’s start with arguably the most important element of the mix — the vocals.

There are numerous ways to use multiband compression on the vocals, and this is perhaps the place where I rely on this tool the most.

The problem with using EQ to address issues on the vocal is that an equalizer is static — but vocals naturally vary wildly in tone. Every time the vocalist changes register, or applies vibrato to their voice, the tone changes.

Relying on EQ alone to remove ugliness from a vocal can ruin the tone in other sections. Let’s say you cut 200-500Hz because the vocal sounds a bit muddy in the verse.

But then, the vocalist moves up an octave for the chorus — suddenly their voice sounds thin and weak because you cut out all the warmth.

Instead, use a multiband compressor to reduce 200-500Hz only when it becomes an issue.

Adjust the bands until you’re focusing on this range, and then adjust the threshold until the compressor engages only on the problematic sections. Don’t apply any makeup gain — you want to dip these frequencies when they get too loud.

This way the chorus is left untouched. Now the vocal sounds clearer in the verse, but full and warm in the chorus.

You can use this same approach to control harshness, sibilance, nasal tones — any ugliness that is only present in certain sections or phrases.

### 2. Adding Consistent Bottom to the Vocal

Let’s stay on the vocals. This time, instead of controlling ugliness, you can use multiband compression to add a consistent low end to the vocal.

Remember, vocals vary dramatically in tone depending on register, vibrato and a range of other factors. Sometimes, when a vocalist moves up in register to falsetto (or ’head voice’), the tone suddenly becomes thin and weak.

Instead of boosting the low end, try using multiband compression to make the low end more consistent. Try compressing everything below 80Hz (this seems low, but you will still hear it) and applying makeup gain to bring it back up to the same volume.

Now, when the vocalist moves to a higher note, you still have the fullness and body that you have in lower registers.

### 3. Making Room for the Vocal with a Sidecain

Here’s one last way to improve the lead vocal with multiband compression — but this time, you aren’t compressing the vocal itself.

Instead, load up a multiband compressor on any instruments that are competing with the lead vocal (guitars, snares, backing vocals). Now, if you have a plugin that supports it, set the lead vocal as the sidechain.

Your aim here is to compress the competing instruments when the vocal comes in. This creates more space for the vocal in the mix. But instead of compressing the entire frequency range, you can just drop out the frequencies that are most prominent in the vocal.

Let’s say you have a male lead vocal that has a lot of energy around 150Hz, and you have also applied a boost at 1kHz to help it cut through.

Try dipping 100Hz to 1kHz on the snare, guitar or backing vocal every time the lead vocal comes in (using the sidechain). This way, you’re creating space for the vocal where it needs it, rather than compressing the entire frequency range of these competing parts.

You could even send all of these parts to a buss and compress them all at once.
