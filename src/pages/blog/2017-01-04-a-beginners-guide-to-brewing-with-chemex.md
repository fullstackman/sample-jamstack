This week, I'm taking the server offline for good. My co-signers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that it would be _unwise _but I cannot tolerate the fan noise any longer!

## If You're Reading This, It's Too Late

I'm not stupid! There is no way I was going to post this to the public Internet and leave you with enough time to stop my plans. I'd much rather be there to see the look on your face when you realized what has actually happened. Thank you for your time.

Goodbye
