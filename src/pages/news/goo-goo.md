I like a contrast when you sing a duet with someone. Itâ€™s what makes it most interesting. If the voices sound too much alike, then it becomes more of a chorus than a duet. We hand-picked everyone on the "Duets" projects so that it would be a good fit and I think each and every one of the tracks on those albums had their own style and feel to it, which was what we intended.
